Description: # ELECTRICALPYTHON
        *Electrical-Engineering-for-Python*
        
        Python Libraries with functions and constants related to electrical engineering.
        
        The functions and constants that make up these modules represent a library of material compiled with the intent of being used primarily
        for research, development, education, and exploration in the realm of electrical engineering.

        In this repository, there are:
        - EESIGNAL (Used primarily for signals and systems or signal/power quality)
        - EEPOWER (Used primarily for electrical power calculations)
          - CAPACITOR (Special functions related to capacitors in electrical engineering)
          - PERUNIT (Special functions related to Per-Unit calculations)
        
        ### Dependencies:
        - NUMPY
        - MATPLOTLIB
        - SCIPY
        
        
        ## INSTALLATION:
         1. Install required dependencies (NUMPY, SCIPY, and MATPLOTLIB)
            - `pip install numpy`
            - `pip install scipy`
            - `pip install matplotlib`
          
         2. Install *electricalpython*
            - `pip install electricalpython`
          
         3. Check installation success in Python environment
        
           ```
           import eepower
           eepower.ver
           ```
           
           ```
           import eesignal
           eesignal.ver
           ```
